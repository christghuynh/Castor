Castor is a web app that is designed to track your daily calendar, as well as your list of assignments to study for. 
With the help of Justin Beaver, our lovely Canadian mascot, the web app automatically allocates time in your schedule 
to study as soon as you enter your school work. When it's time to study, Castor helps you use the famous and very 
effective _pomodoro studying technique_. Studying time is divided into sessions of 25 minutes, plus 5-minute breaks. 
During each break, play a quick, relaxing mini-game with Justin Beaver to checkpoint your studying!
